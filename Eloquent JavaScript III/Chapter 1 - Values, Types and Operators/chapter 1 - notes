Special numbers
There are three special values in JavaScript that are considered numbers but don’t behave like normal numbers. The first two are Infinity and -Infinity, which represent the positive and negative infinities. Infinity
- 1 is still Infinity, and so on. Don’t put too much trust in infinity- based computation, though. It isn’t mathematically sound, and it will quickly lead to the next special number: NaN.
NaN stands for “not a number”, even though it is a value of the number type. You’ll get this result when you, for example, try to calculate 0 / 0 (zero divided by zero), Infinity - Infinity, or any number of other
numeric operations that don’t yield a meaningful result.

`half of 100 is ${100 / 2}`
22
When you write something inside ${} in a template literal, its result will be computed, converted to a string, and included at that position. This example produces “half of 100 is 50”.
